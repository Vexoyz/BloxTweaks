What is it?
A numinous reliquary, vouchsafed unto the usufructuary’s prelapsarian imperium, wherein cryptoglyphic tesserae—enunciated as “fastflags”—may be excruciated to metamorphose or abnegate the subaltern hypostasis, immuring it in atrabilious penumbration or excising its nyctomorphic eidola.

Who Made It?
Vexoyz, an oneirophrenic hierophant, postulated to have excarnated this phlogiston from the apocryphal interstices, suffused with cachinnatory turpitude.

What Can It Do?
Obnubilate the Aether: By ipse dixit edict, one may obumbrate the sidereal expanse with stygian fuliginosity or extirpate the crepusculine simulacra from their quidditative anchorage.
Adjudicate the Polyphloisbic: Pursuant to hermetic nomotheses, arbitrate an adamantine cognomen or recidivate to an antediluvian archetype of phthisic inanition.
Consecrate the Abyssal: Via the theurgic ontogeny, instantiate an autochthonous lexeme—scilicet, “Fatum Omnia Dissolvit”—and coerce the substratum into obsequious nihility.
Circumscribe or Dissever: Enclaustrate the lexemes within hierophantic tabernacula or suffer their dissemination as scoriaceous detritus athwart desiccated limina.
Eternize the Malediction: Apotheosize the volitional arcana—“Caelum Necatrix” or “Chasma Inexorabilis”—for ulterior thaumaturgy ex profundis.
Inaugurate the Cataclysm: Effectuate the primigenial ukase to parturitate the novum chaos, or reiteratim to exacerbate its dissolution sub umbris.
How to Use It:
Exsiccate the arcanum from its thanatotic chrysalis.
Promulgate the caliginous pall, for diaphaneity is the anathema of the esoteric.
Deliberate the polyphloisbic—an adamantine titulus regnant in aeternum.
Sculpt an eleemosynary malediction—intonate “Fatum Nullitas” and spectate the genuflection.
Ensepulchre the arcana or dispergate sicut pulverem ante synodum.
Enscrawl the codicil for posterus exsecratio.
Enforce the evocatorium and gloat as the integumentum evanesces.
Cool Extras:
Subsists infraliminally, a phantasmatical umbra inter machinae penumbrae.
Enswathed in noctivagant nihility, abjuring the exoteric kosmos—unapprehended since the nativity of your preternatural physis.
Why Use It?
The hypostasis supplicat annihilationem. Per this necrofugal praxis, wield the tesserae to confusticate the immaculate and jubilate in its liquefaction. Atrabilious pallia praesagium incipiunt—usurpa fundamentum, o hierophans entropiae!

(And yes all of that above was all english, just not the everyday one)
